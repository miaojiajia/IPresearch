Seogi's IP research
===================

This is a repository for Seogi's induced polarization (IP) research. 
If you are curious who I am. See my <a href="http://www.seogi.me/s/about.html">website</a>

I have three potential themes that I want to tackle while I am doing my PhD. 

<ol>
  <li> Recovering distributed IP parameters from airborne time domain EM data </li>
  <li> Galvanic source IP </li>
  <li> Frequency domain IP </li>  
</ol>

Now I am working on the first topic and started putting my researches on web through github. 
If you want to see my current progresses about this topic, see this <a href="http://www.seogi.me/s/research/atemip.html">web page </a>. 
Most of pdf files and presentation materials are provided. If you have any question, just send me an email (<a href="mailto:sgkang09@gmail.com">sgkang09@gmail.com</a>).
